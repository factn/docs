# Local Resilience App

**Goal**: To build a compelling app for local resilience. We are building a strong feedback loop from on-the-ground community organizers and UX/design teams in order to fully capture and prioritize user stories for our app. In the meantime we are building our version 2 app based on what we already know. We want to architect and develop a scalable product to meet the needs of local communities in the short, medium, and post-pandemic long-term. This is a multi-team effort involving copywriting, design/UX, front/back-end development, and data science.
