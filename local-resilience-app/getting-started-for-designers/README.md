# Getting Started for Designers

Hi there designers! Designers in open source software is historcially a rare thing! But here we're keen to have designers of all kinds (UX, Research, UI, Interaction etc.) join us to help make our resiliance app more usable and friendly for users globally.


### Get access to the right tools

With Open Source Design, we make do with existing design collaboration tools as much as possible. Figma is great for shared artboards but really, aiming to not be reliant on any particular commerical design tool initially is key. What your design contributions need to be however is:

- Openable by your design peers by any computer and on multiple products. Saving just in .jpg .xd .sketch makes it hard to work across tools. Try using a fairly universal .svg format.

- Make your files available and upload new versions regularly. If you're uploading design files outside of a browser based design tool, consider adding dates and information in a message on slack to help with design version control.

- Viewable, clickable prototypes. These can be created in most tools and should have a team comment function.
