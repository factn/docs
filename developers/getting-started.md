# Getting Started

Remember, we’re just a group of people volunteering and self-organizing. Leave notes, ask questions, and know that any work at all is appreciated. :-\)

## First. You need access.

**Developer Tasks** are here: [Resilience App - AirTable](https://airtable.com/tblRjd2McKgRW9MKj/viwlRRNI0PZIxrGkc?blocks=hide)

* Anyone can view. To pick up a task, get added as an editor by asking @beth, @Erika\_Margaret, @Miles, @Terrance @Joshkurzich or @Tuan 

**Development Work** happens here: [Resilience App - GitHub](https://github.com/factn/resilience-app)

* Read through the documentation in the homepage README and [CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/factn/resilience-app/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) to learn how to work with us

  \*Check out the working [demo](https://mutualaidworld-frontend.herokuapp.com/) of the app

  **Second. Check out the process.**

  **For new developer:**

* Please checkout github issues and if you do not have access to assign yourself to it just yet, just write a comment in the github issue, and then contact @miles to get access.

**Grab a Task** in AirTable

* On top left, go to “Stories” tab and switch between **Dev Kanban** and **Story Refinement**
* Under  Dev Kanban, you'll find a column called **Backlog**

   Pick out a task from there, assign it to yourself, and move the card to **In Progress** status

* Once the task is developed, create a Pull Request in GitHub, go back to the card in AirTable to add a link to the pull request, then slide that card over to **Code Review**

**Questions** about work

* Post questions in Slack! You have great resources in the following channels:
  * **\#resilience-app**
  * **\#resilience-design**
  * **\#project-management**
