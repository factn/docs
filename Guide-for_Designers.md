Remember, we’re just a group of people volunteering and self-organizing. Leave notes, ask questions, and know that any work at all is appreciated. :-)

# First. You need access.
<b>Design Tasks</b> are here: [MutualAid.World - Airtable](https://airtable.com/invite/l?inviteId=invAIFQQVcucfXfWx&inviteToken=a9ca21ad9b07a25b40d520f6c43855b006dd83b61cdccbb38799dcac551a4b0d)
* Anyone can view. To pick up a task, get added as an editor by asking @beth, @Erika_Margaret, @Miles, @Terrance or @Tuan

<b>Design Work</b> happens here: [MutualAid.World - Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/v5HdxDsvO2NzMuZU6CArzF/MutualAid.world-Designs-in-progress?node-id=1%3A2)
* Anyone can view. To work on a task, get added as an editor by asking anyone who currently has access, or more specifically, @beth or @Nena.
* As of March 19th, Nena secured us unlimited seats with Figma for 6 months!

# Second. Check out the process.
<b>Grab a Task</b> in AirTable
* On top left, go to “Stories” tab and switch between <b>Development</b> and <b>Design</b>
* Under <b>Design</b>, you’ll find a column called <b>UI/UX Design.</b>
* Pick out a task from there, note if it’s for <b>skateboard, scooter,</b> or <b>bicycle</b> and assign it to yourself. (Huh? [Skateboard, Scooter, Bicycle](https://blog.crisp.se/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Making-sense-of-MVP-.jpg))
* Once the task is designed in Figma, go back to AirTable and slide that block over to <b>User Story Creation.</b>

<b>Do the Work</b> in Figma
* Make sure you are working in the correct section of Figma “skateboard, scooter, or bicycle”
* <b>Note: </b> Figma is our source of truth for design. We’re working collaboratively, all over the world and at different times and with different personal processes. If/when you edit a global style or component, take a look to see what else has changed and leave a note in Figma or in Slack to let the team know what’s shifted. 

<b>Questions</b> about work
* Post questions in slack or collect them in Figma. If you get good answers, put them in places in Figma where they will be the most helpful.

<b>Approvals</b> for work
* <b>Skateboard</b> and <b>scooter stages:</b> Connect with the Collaborators on your task, and if you need more approval than that, throw something in slack.
* <b>Bicycle</b> stage: @Linc is the product owner for sign-off.

# Third. Here are some resources.
